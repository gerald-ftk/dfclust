An implementation of [Efﬁcient Large-Scale Face Clustering Using an Online Mixture of
Gaussians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.17272v1)

Uses git lfs for the test.npz file.
The test.npz contains features generated by insightface's ArcFace with 512d features. HDBSCAN labels are also included in the test.npz for reference.

After setting up your environment and installing requirements, run:
```
python3 scripts/plot.py
```

To generate a bokeh graph of the online clustering algorithm.
